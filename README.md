# Collecting Results
In this example, the results would be output to the client's database and would track which customers would benefit most from either benefit oriented language variant A or variant B.


# Hypothetical Result:
The results report that overall customers who observed the variant B message were more likely to retain their subscription.
This is because 80% of customers retained saw this message. Only 40% of customers who saw the variant A message retained their subscription.

# Conclusion:
Benefit oriented language variant B enabled more customers to retain their subscription.
